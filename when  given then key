The Given-When-Then (GWT) keywords are used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to define tests in a natural language style. 

1. Given: Sets the context for the test. It describes the initial state of the system or the preconditions for the test.
2. When: Describes the action or event that triggers the test. It specifies what is being tested.
3. Then: Describes the expected outcome or result of the test. It specifies what should happen as a result of the action or event.

Example:

1. Given I am on the login page
2. When I enter my username and password
3.Then I should be logged in successfully
